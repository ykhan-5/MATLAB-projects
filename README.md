## Project 1
### Section 1: CHEE Data Analysis

Our project focused on investigating the aqueous reaction between BOND and SIMMONS to produce URH. We analyzed data from a spreadsheet, created visualizations, and developed a model to estimate the experiment's completion time based on the provided definition of completion.

### Section 2: Matrix Manipulation

In this section, we completed many matrix operations, including finding data, matrix addition, and matrix multiplication. 

### Section 3: Arrhenius Equation & Linear Regression Statistics 

In this section, we worked with a large data set in order to understand the Arrhenius Equation. We were tasked with transforming the experimental data, as well as finding trends such as slope, intercepts, and finding the coefficient of determination for each data set.

### Section 4: Anonymous Functions

In this section, we explored creating functions within Matlab. 

## Project 2

### Section 3: Paper Chromatography App

Our objective in this section was to develop a user-friendly app that enables users to select chromatography strips and determine the presence of compounds in their experiments. By comparing the selected strip with a standard strip, the app helps identify the compounds present.

## Project 3

### Section 1: Encryption and Decryption App 

This MATLAB app allowed a user to shift an inputted string x amount of time in order to "decrypt" a message. It could also do the opposite, allowing a user with a key (the number of shifts) to decrypt the message. 

### Section 2: Axial Stress, Strain, and Elongation of a Beam Due to a Point Force 

In this section, we created an app to predict the behavior of a cantilever beam subject to an axial, tensile force. The user is able to specify the material, dimensions, and magnitude of the force. From these inputs, the app will display the beam's elongation, stress, and strain. 

### Section 3: Axial Stress Due to a Distributed Axial Force 

Unlike the previous section, we will now load the cantilever beam with an axially distributed load. The user is asked to provide the beam dimensions and total distributed force.
