## Project 1
### Section 1: CHEE Data Analysis

Our project focused on investigating the aqueous reaction between BOND and SIMMONS to produce URH. We analyzed data from a spreadsheet, created visualizations, and developed a model to estimate the experiment's completion time based on the provided definition of completion.

### Section 2: Matrix Manipulation

In this section, we completed many matrix operations, including finding data, matrix addition, and matrix multiplication. 

### Section 3: Arrhenius Equation & Linear Regression Statistics 

In this section, we worked with a large data set in order to understand the Arrhenius Equation. We were tasked with transforming the experimental data, as well as finding trends such as slope, intercepts, and finding the coefficient of determination for each data set.

### Section 4: Anonymous Functions

In this section, we explored creating functions within Matlab.
